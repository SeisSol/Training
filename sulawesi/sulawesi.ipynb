    "This dynamic rupture earthquake scenario, featuring sustained supershear rupture propagation, matches key earthquake observational data, including its moment magnitude, rupture duration, fault plane solution, teleseismic waveforms, and inferred horizontal ground displacements. All faults are loaded by a uniform stress regime reflecting regional transtension which leads to spontaneous accumulation of a combination of up to 6 m left-lateral slip and up to 2 m normal slip on the fault segment dipping 65 degrees East beneath Palu Bay. We will see that the dynamic rupture model produces overall left-lateral, dominantly strike-slip faulting across the curved, bend, connected fault segments. \n",

    "1. CAD 1: Creating a high-resolution topography and bathymetry which represent the model's free surface. Merging it with a simple 3D volume (e.g. a box);\n",
    "2. CAD 2: Creating the complex fault network constrained by fault traces and varying fault dip and intersect all faults with each other and with topo-bathymetry in a manifold manner;\n",
    "3. Mesh: Automatic volumetric meshing using unstructured tetrahedral elements. Keep in mind our two differing resolution criteria: the CFL criterion determines the required resolution for the wave propagation, and the dynamic rupture process zone/cohesive zone size, the region behind the rupture front where the fault strength drops from its static to dynamic level ([Day et al., 2005](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005jb003813); for SeisSol: [Wollherr et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/214/3/1556/5017447?login=true)).\n",

The prescribed resolution here is 800 m element edge length everywhere on the fault, and static mesh-coarsening away from the fault system. The published high-resolution mesh, for comparison, consists of 8 million elements, decreasing the shortest element edge lengths to 200 m close to faults."
