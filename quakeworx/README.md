The files in this directory have been adjusted compared to the "standard" SeisSol training repository to be readily used for a science gateway for seismic simulations: [Quakeworx Kick-off: Advancing Earthquake Science and Cybertraining in Seismology](https://quakeworx.org/events/quakeworx-kick-off-workshop)

The input files for the Gateway can be downloaded [here](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiVsNGoWemY1u7To7Gh1pg/quakeworx.zip) as well if you do not have access to Git.
