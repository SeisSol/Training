The files in this directory have been adjusted compared to the "standard" SeisSol training repository to be readily used for a science gateway for seismic simulations: [Quakeworx Kick-off: Advancing Earthquake Science and Cybertraining in Seismology](https://quakeworx.org/events/quakeworx-kick-off-workshop)

The simplest way to access the input files for the Gateway is by running ``git clone https://github.com/SeisSol/Training.git`` from your terminal locally. Make sure to navigate into the folder _quakeworx_ when uploading the input files to the SeisSol App from the Gateway.
