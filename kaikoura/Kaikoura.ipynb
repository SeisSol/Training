    "# SeisSol 3D dynamic rupture training example: the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikōura, New Zealand earthquake\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a scaled-down version of the complex 3D dynamic rupture model published in [Ulrich et al., Nat. Comms., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09125-w).\n",

    "The dynamic rupture earthquake scenario, eproduces key characteristics of the earthquake and constraints puzzling features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed. This model shows that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic and geodetic data. Our model proposes that the complex fault system operates at low apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids, low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep.\n",

    "*Fault network geometry prescribed for dynamic earthquake rupture modeling. Colors on fault surfaces indicate dipping angle (dip), highlighting the flattening with depth of the Jordan Thrust, Kekerengu, and Needles faults. All segments dip westwards, except for the Humps Fault Zone. The Hope, Culverden, and Leonard Mound faults, dipping, respectively, 70° toward NorthWest, 70° toward South, and 50° toward SouthEast, are displayed in yellow. These faults do not rupture in our dynamic rupture model. Also shown are the high-resolution topography and bathymetry (Mitchell et al., 2012), and S-wave speeds (Vs) on four cross-sections of the 3D subsurface structure (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2010) incorporated in the model.*\n"

    "To build 3D models with complicated geometries that are beyond the capabilities of gmsh we are using [SimModeler](http://www.simmetrix.com/index.php/simmodeler/overview), a software that is free for academic use. \n",
    "The necessary mesh generation steps include:\n",
    "1. CAD 1: Creating a high-resolution topography and bathymetry which represent the model's free surface. Merging it with a simple 3D volume (e.g. a box);\n",
    "2. CAD 2: Creating the complex fault network constrained by fault traces and varying fault dip and intersect all faults with each other and with topo-bathymetry in a manifold manner;\n",
    "3. Mesh: Automatic volumetric meshing using unstructured tetrahedral elements. Keep in mind our two differing resolution criteria: the CFL criterion determines the required resolution for seismic wave propagation, and the dynamic rupture process zone/cohesive zone size, the region behind the rupture front where the fault strength drops from its static to dynamic level ([Day et al., 2005](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005jb003813); for SeisSol: [Wollherr et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/214/3/1556/5017447?login=true)).\n",

    "*Snapshot of the wavefield (absolute particle velocity in m/s) across the fault network at a rupture time of 55 s. The high-resolution model is discretized by an unstructured mesh accounting for three-dimensional (3D) subsurface structure and high-resolution topography and featuring refined resolution in the vicinity of the faults. It incorporates the nonlinear interaction between frictional on-fault failure, off-fault plasticity, and seismic wave propagation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We recorded two (non-narrated) demos of all meshing steps for a similar mesh using Simmodeler and a few simple scripts available in the SeisSol repository, which are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3mTAoPTAyUMdXfTzW_Ap62u4EpJM0Zf/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ts3QZCWUeHMwB3ZEhUpV-CmNcG-4Vwj8/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this training, we provide a pre-prepared smaller mesh file (approx. 280,000 elements) and first visualize it. The prescribed resolution here is 1500 m element edge length everywhere on the faults, and static mesh-coarsening away from the fault system. The published high-resolution mesh, for comparison, consists of 29 million elements, decreasing the shortest element edge lengths to 300 m close to faults, and at most 1000 m close to topography and bathymetry resolving the seismic wavefield at frequencies up to 3 Hz in the source region."

SeisSol with rate and state friction will run fast if compiled with a commercial compiler such as intel, as available on most clusters.
